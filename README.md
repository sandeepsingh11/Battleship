# Battleship
Java game for the board game Battleship.

This is a personal project I am currently doing to practice my Java skills.
To play the current beta game, download the zip folder. After extracting, go to the 'dist' folder, then double click the 'Battleship.jar' file to execute the game.


Enjoy the prototype I have :)
